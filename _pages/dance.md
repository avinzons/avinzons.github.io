Alexis Vinzons is a New York City-based freelance dance artist from Westchester, NY. She is a facilitator of Emergent Improvisation, a practice crafted by Troy Ogilvie and Omar Zubair, held regularly at Gibney Dance Center and Peridance Center. Her improvisation practice takes an anatomical approach and investigates honesty, spontaneity, curiosity, and care as essential lenses for engaging with and reconnecting to dance. She holds a B.A. from Cornell University, where she studied Information Science, art history, and dance.
