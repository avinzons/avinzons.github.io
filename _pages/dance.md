### Emergent Improvisation
Facilitated and crafted by [Troy Ogilvie](https://troyogilvie.squarespace.com/) and [Omar Zubair](https://soundcloud.com/omar-zubair) and built from the teachings of adrienne maree brown [(author of Emergent Strategy)](https://adriennemareebrown.net/book/emergent-strategy/), Emergent Improvisation uses dance, sound, and environment to facilitate a deep sense of listening, creating an ecosystem of community care. Building on the concepts of iteration, fractals, and expanding possibilities, we engage in the act of futuring and world-building within the context of dance improvisation.
