A casual list of ideas, books, quotes, articles, and art that I reference often enough to keep a list documented somewhere:
* The Art of Loving by Erich Fromm (1956)
* David Orr's review of The Most Read Poem in America- "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost [link](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/09/11/the-most-misread-poem-in-america/)
