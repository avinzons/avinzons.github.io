involvement: I served as the Marketing and Design Director in addition to being a co-founder of the Cornell Dancers' Alliance
tools: Figma

challenge: Every year, dance clubs and teams at Cornell host workshops during Freshman Orientation Week. This year, the Cornell Dancers' Alliance helped with logistics in scheduling and finding space for dozens of workshops and created a cohesive marketing brand for the workshops.

outcome: I designed the marketing materials for the event, which attracted over 200 students, mostly incoming freshman and members of the Cornell Dance Community.
