subtitle: Cornell Dancers' Alliance
image: danceoweekworkshops/coverphoto.png
involvement: I served as the Marketing and Design Director in addition to being a
  co-founder of the Cornell Dancers' Alliance
tools: Figma
challenge: Every year, dance clubs and teams at Cornell host workshops during Freshman
  Orientation Week. This year, the Cornell Dancers' Alliance helped with logistics
  in scheduling and finding space for dozens of workshops and created a cohesive marketing
  brand for the workshops.
outcome: I designed the marketing materials for the event, which attracted over 200
  students, mostly incoming freshman and members of the Cornell Dance Community.
