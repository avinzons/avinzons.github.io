## Sensemaking in transition: Using participatory diagramming to elicit mental models of secondary transition

### ABSTRACT

The successful transition of students with disabilities from secondary
education to adult life is influenced by a complex network of laws,
people, places, organizations and activities. An acute sensemaking
problem exists in this domain whereby key stakeholders are not informed
of evidence-based predictors of post-school success such as parental
involvement and work-based learning. This study uses participatory
diagramming to elicit network diagrams and timelines from parents,
educators and domain experts. These diagrams are analyzed to visually
understand participant mental models related to transition and work.
Role, authority and conflict have emerged as three key themes from these
mental models. In the future, we hope to further develop this
methodology and the resulting mental models to inform the development of
strategies and instructional assets to improve transition sensemaking.
