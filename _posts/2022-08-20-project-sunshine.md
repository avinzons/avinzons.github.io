### About Project Sunshne
In the U.S, 1.3 million children are hospitalized annually and 15 million children aged 6 - 17 live with a chronic illness. Children with chronic conditions often experience increased stress and isolation, and many of their interactions are centered around their medical conditions.

**Project Sunshine** is an international nonprofit organization that brings moments of joy,
comfort, and play to children facing medical challenges. For 25 years, we have been
transforming the often overwhelming experience of hospitalization by providing fun,
engaging, and therapeutic programs for children and their families.

### Funds for Fun
Funds for Fun is a peer-led fundraiser run by Project Sunshine Canada. I created a playful spin-off Project Sunshine's brand assets for volunteers to use on their fundraising pages and social media posts.

## Events
Project Sunshine hosts two annual fundraising events- the Golf Classic and the Project Sushine Gala, for which I helped create event-specific print materials (program booklets, table cards, table signs), digital materials (landing pages, forms, website banners) and signage and banners.
