            <p>As one of two designers for this project, I aimed to design and prototype a mobile app for The Cornell Daily Sun that would engage current and new audiences. I helped lead our user research initiatives, including recruitment, survey design,  interviews, and later, testing. I also worked on the information architecutre of the app, as well as</td>

        <p>The Cornell Daily Sun is Cornell’s oldest and only independent, student-run newspaper. It reporting on events at Cornell, in Ithaca, or related to Cornellians.
        The <span class="article-emphasis">goal</span> was this project was to create an iOS app for The Cornell Daily Sun that would retain and engage current and prospective readers of The Sun. We believed a mobile application was a necessary and progressive extension of The Sun’s current print and web platforms, as it provides a much more direct access to The Sun’s news content.</p>

        <h1>Our Users: Readers of The Sun</h1>

        <p>In the first round of interviews, we sought to understand the behaviors of the readers of The Sun. We asked them what platforms they used, how often they read, how they browse, in what contexts and settings they read, and what was their motivations for reading. We also wanted to find out why people do not read The Sun and how an app might influence how people read.</p>

        <p>In addition to contextual interviews, we sent out a google form to subscribers of The Sun and students at Cornell for their input.</p>

        <h2>Some key findings:</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>A vast majority of readers access articles through shared posts on Facebook. And a majority of readers tend to read on their laptop over any other medium</li>
            <li>50% of respondents read The Sun a few times a week, 21% daily, and 12% once a week. Most read 2–3 articles at a time.</li>
            <li>Nearly everyone reads the front page/headline news, 60% of respondents read Local News and Opinion articles, and other sections attract 10–25% of those surveyed.</li>
            <li>People do not read The Sun because they do not have time, are not interested in the articles, or because the newspaper is not readily available to them.</li>
          </ol>

        <p>While not all of these translate into direct design decisions, they are important when designing with the user in mind.</p>

        <h1>Information ArchitectureFrom Findings to Features</h1>
        <p>One goal of the user research phase was to identify the product features that would meet user needs. From our research, we identitied the following features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Main Feed</li>
            <li>Section Feed</li>
            <li>Search</li>
            <li>Trending Topics</li>
            <li>Bookmarks</li>
            <li>Notifications</li>
            <li>Settings</li>
          </ul>    
        <ul>
          <li>What is the relationship between these features?</li>
          <li>How should these features be organized in a way that matches the user's conceptual of information?</li>
        </ul>
        My goal was to explore how a user can navigate the app. We prioritized simplicity and intuition. We want all of our features to be seamlessly accessible, while taking into consideration hierarchy of user actions, based on user tests.

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>
        <img class="from-medium" src="images/dailysun-navexplor1.png">
        <p> I looked to both news apps and social media apps for inspiration. features in navigation bars: main feed, videos, market place, notifications, menu, home, news, video, quizzes, search, add photo, activity, personal profile</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blank Search — no content, just search bar</li>
            <li>List of Trending Topics — centered list of 8–10 topics</li>
            <li>“More Interesting Lists” — a list, like above, with a little more to it, such as images and short descriptions</li>
            <l>“Multi-layout Lists” — these had more than one kind of content on the search page. For example, Instagram has a list of users’ stories as well as a mosaic of user posts, and Bloomberg has colored cards for different sections as well as a list of trending topics.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I noticed that there was a significant difference in what kind of apps used the difference categories of Search Screens: News apps tended to use Blank Search or Trending while social media apps used “More Interesting Lists” and “Multi-layout Lists.” I reasoned that this was because:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>searching on Social Media apps often meant expanding outside one’s social circle- this is why Instagram calls their search section “Explore”, separating subscribed from unsubscribed content.</li>
            <li>The content of social media apps like Facebook tends to be more complex, while on a news app there is typically only one kind of content- news articles.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>I considered the Blank Search Screen, and questioned why many apps used it. One possible reason was perhaps not to distract users from what they meant to search. However, if what they were going to search was presented to them in a list of trending topics, then they wouldn’t have to type in the search, thus bridging the gulf of execution. If users were going to search something, why not at least try to predict what they were going to search for? Thus, I decided to go with a list of trending topics.
        Explorations</p>
        <img>
        <p>A neatly spaced sample of my exploration artboards</p>

        <h3>Click-ability</h3>
        <img class="from-medium" src="images/dailysun-clickability.png">
        <p>My first iterations drew from the centered topic list of the apps I looked at for inspiration. Yet one critique I received was that these designs didn’t look “clickable”. I questioned what about the layout, font style, color, or spacing could render text “clickable”. This was something that I explored and strove for in future designs.</p>
        <h3>Working with Content</h3>
        <img class="from-medium" src="images/dailysun-content.png"
        <p>We met with editors of The Sun to learn about how they tag and report on certain topics. For developing stories, they release update articles periodically. So I explored displaying the time last updated. However, after closer examination of the content on The Sun, I learned that they rarely have several on-going developing stories and most of their pieces are standalone. At a time, there might be 0–3 of these stories. While I decided not to include this metadata in the design, the developing stories edge case might be interesting to explore in future versions of the app.</p>
        <h3>Negative Space</h3>
        <img class="from-medium" src="images/dailysun-negativespace.png">
        <p>While exploring improving click-ability, I thought about each trending topic as it’s own element or entity on the screen. Clicking each one brings the user to a different page with different articles and information. Yet they are all “trending topics”, so there must be both coherence and differentiation. I explored how to use negative space and separation to emphasize this. I also looked to iOS 11’s search display for inspiration with layout and negative space. From the three above, I decided to pursue the one on the right, as it puts more emphasis on the search bar than the other designs, while still highlighting the (click-able) trending topics.</p>
