        <p> I'll be the first to say that I'm not the best visual designer. I was never one of those art-school-dreaming kids in high school- the ones that crafted intricate caricatures in the margins of their notebooks, or scored perfectly in AP Art.</p>
        <p>But as a designer, I do very much value visuals and aesthetics. My feat into this field prompted me to question: "What makes good visual design?" And since then, I've been asking myself that everyday, exploring visuals we see everyday and iterating on my own definition.</p>
        <p>I realized this endeavor to answer a question required me to produce on my own work. Creating good visual design is it's own process, even if we only see the final product. As an undergraduate at Cornell, I recently started a new student organization for which I've been designing marketing materials. I was tasked with creating an event poster, and eagerly put on my visual design hat, pulled out my design tools, and set to work.</p>
        <p>Then came the moment of truth (disclaimer: possible dramatization).</p>
        <p>They squinted their eyes and pursed their lips and tentatively expressed their lack of satisfaction. Then, they pounced. They wanted to see the text in some other font and the background in some other color, and I let them take control of that spur in the moment suggestion.</p>
        <p>It was like the kind of client work where the client wants to be the designer, nit-picking. And I saw my hours of concept development and of visual iteration and exploration crumbled. I felt <span class="article-emphasis">defeated</span>.</p>     
        <p>But I "iterate" on all of my experiences, and asked myself What went wrong, why did it go wrong, what can I do better next time?</p>
        <p>Here are my take aways</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p class="article-emphasis">Don't walk into a design critique blind.</p><p>I didn't pitch my idea well. I was married to the thought that visual design is subjective- that maybe they'd like it and maybe not and that was fine...? Or, what was I supposed to think of that?</p><p>Crit has a purpose: you ask critique from those whose opinions you value. You give them context, of the project and of your method. Then you listen, whole-heartedly, knowing they'll look for the bad, but being okay with that.</li>
          <li><p class="article-emphasis">Trust yourself, and be decisive.</p><p>My co-eboard-members trusted me to create something. I should take their thoughts into consideration, but I have to be decisive and confident myself in what I really believe in.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>So where does my ego come in?</p>
        <p>I designed something that I liked, first and foremost. I was my first critic. After experiencing rejection, I somberly returned to my design tools and started designing more things I liked. This is the ego monster, the one that will swallow you whole, as you wallow in your defeat. It's okay to feel defeated, but I learned that I have to pick myself back up and learn from this.</p>
        <p>Turns out, my ego monster was there all along: she was the constant affirmation as I was exploring and iterating on designs. She built up the esteem until it came to <span class="article-emphasis">real</span> critique with <span class="article-emphasis">real</span> people.</p>
        <p>So, future self, some life lessons-
          <ul>
            <li>check your ego throughout the design process</li>
            <li>critique is so valuable! know what to ask and how to present, and leave behind your ego monster and bring your humility angel</li>
          </ul>
