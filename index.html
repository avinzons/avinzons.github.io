        <p>Iâ€™m interested in the interplay of humans and computers. Humans- or more casually, people- are both highly independent and dependent. They are independent in their ownership of logical thought processes and decisions, and they are dependent on the synthesis of socio, cultural, and historical factors.</p>
        <p>At the core of human-computer interaction is the concept of aesthetics: how computers are built and designed and how people use and appreciate them. Aesthetics, like people, are a matter of both personal tastes and socio/cultural/historical trends. </p>
        <p>Through design research, I hope to study how aesthetics in technology are cultivated and developed, and how the visual, tactile, interactive, and linguistic components of aesthetics resonate with the vastly extraordinary human users of these technologies.</p>
        <p>I'll be graduating from Cornell University in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts in <a class="emphasis-2" href="https://www.infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science</a>, concentrating in UX.I'm also pursuing two minors in <a href="https://pma.cornell.edu/">dance</a> and <a href="http://arthistory.cornell.edu">art history</a></p>
