       <p>For the course <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA18/class/INFO/6240">INFO 6240: Sensemaking</a>, my team and I conducted a qualitative research study looking at the sensemaking process of transition and work among students with disabilities. Below is the front matter of our final paper; full paper available on request.</p>

      <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
      <p>The successful transition of students with disabilities from secondary education to adult life is influenced by a complex network of laws, people, places, organizations and activities. An acute sensemaking problem exists in this domain whereby key stakeholders are not informed of evidence-based predictors of post-school success such as parental involvement and work-based learning. This study uses participatory diagramming to elicit network diagrams and timelines from parents, educators and domain experts. These diagrams are analyzed to visually understand participant mental models related to transition and work. Role, authority and conflict have emerged as three key themes from these mental models. In the future, we hope to further develop this methodology and the resulting mental models to inform the development of strategies and instructional assets to improve transition sensemaking.</p>
      <h3>KEYWORDS</h3>
